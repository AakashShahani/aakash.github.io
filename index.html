								<h2>Personal Information</h2>
									<p>I’m Aakash Shahani, an 18 year old boy pursuing his bachelor of information technology at RMIT University in Melbourne, Australia. My student number and email address are s3759927 and aakashshahani42@gmail.com respectively.</p>
										<p>I’m basically from India and my last education was 12th year   and in addition to this I had done C-Programming course from India. As India is the country of cultures and people have different cultures and as per me the culture refers to anything like the way of behaving with other, respecting other religions, tradition of arts, festivals, fairs, dance music are also included in our culture.  In addition to that, many different languages are spoken in different religion and caste. I belong to the Hindu religion, but my caste is Sindhi. So, I have been speaking Sindhi, Hindi, Guajarati and English (As I studied in Convent School) languages since from my childhood. And I had being passionate about football and cricket in sports and I can refer them as my hobby and from the last year I had started reading books on autobiography. They work as a stressbuster for me So, playing sports and reading new books are something that I can’t think life without.</p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<h3>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest?</h3>
									<p>From the last few decades, computerization and digitalization has been increasing tremendously. Further, the world wide web, refer as the global information system is loaded with a lot of data and information. In my school life also, I was way ahead at computers, so my teachers motivated and suggested me to choose information technology as a career. They explained me by present scenario of online banking transaction is the good example of the need of secure information system. As the time passed my interest and thirst to attain further education in information technology grew. So, now I am starting my career in Information Technology is because of my school teacher who found that I could do this, and she knew that I had interest in IT.</p>
						
						                <h3>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h3>
									<p>I know as the selection of right candidate is important for the university so is for the student to select the correct university. So of course, such major decisioncannot be taken in haste. No doubt, the name RMIT University is enough, but I got the momentum by information from a senior, and a few well-wishers. As I found RMIT University’s undergraduate program in Information technology covers all subjects which I am interested most. However, I must say the real magnet was the research of Professor Ellie Rennie on Cyber safety in remote Aboriginal communities, which I think would undoubtedly help me in strengthening my understanding of cyber security and its’ applications. The quality that has attracted me a lot about your university is, it creates management and leadership qualities necessary to advance career options. The best research facilities, eminent faculty and the vibrant atmosphere of the university have really astonished me.</p>
								
						                <h3>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h3>
									<p>I want to acquire all the skills to solve, support, troubleshoot and design, everything from web sites to programming networks required to become an IT consultant. And I think by working in a group project, I would be able to learn Great communication and leadership skills, quick learner, good listener, confident decision making etc. which are necessary to become an IT consultant.</p>

								<h2 class="major">IDEAL JOB</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>I desire to have the unique ability to pick the job opportunities best suited for me when and where I want.. As a consultant I would have the flexibility to contract with diverse group of organizations on exciting and challenging projects. Because the strategic initiatives often require niche IT skills, companies are often willing to provide higher compensations for qualifies consultants.  </p>
							
						             <h3>The job advertisement itself. Include a link, and a snapshot of it </h3>
									<p>This is the job advertisement link I think as my ideal job at present.</p>
							     <h3> A description (in your own words) of the position, and particularly what makes this position appealing to you</h3>
									<p>The position of IT consultant is about dealing with the clients of any sector and helping them to understand the technology and IT resources, advising them to overcome their problems and how to improve their systems to work effectively and efficiently. As I am very extrovert person and like to communicate with other so, I think I would be able to make clients understand/convince clearly about the IT resources and technology.</p>
							     <h3>A description (in your own words) of the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position.</h3>
									<p>The main skill for the position of an IT consultant is a great communication skill and the deep knowledge about the software, media and hardware. Able to work with different programming language and have prior experience working with multiple servers. To be updated with new technologies. Minimum a bachelor’s degree In Information technology, Computer Science or related field. And I think minimum of 1-year experience and it varies with position. So, I think 3-4 years of experience would be ideal to run their own consultation services.  </p>
							     <h3>  A description (in your own words) of the skills, qualifications and experience you currently have. </h3>
									<p>Currently, I am not having any work experience in the IT field as I just started Bachelor of Information Technology, but I have the certificate of C-programming Language and I am having a good communication skill (but not the great one) which I would have to develop during my studies. </p>
								
						             <h3> A plan describing how you will obtain the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position, building on those you have now.</h3>
									<p>During my studies, I think I will acquire all the knowledge about the IT and willing to have some niche IT skills. I would start working on my Interpersonal and communication skills which would be very helpful for my ideal job (as of now IT consultant). And to start networking with the people who are serious about their goals. I am planning to get into internship during my 3rd -year and after that to get into the entry level IT jobs to gain some work experience. Further to get the professional   certification to reach my goal of starting my own consultation services.</p>

								<p>Smart Health Monitoring Application </p>
							         <h3>Overview </h3>
							            <p>The Health Monitoring application would focus on maintaining the health of people and advising them to achieve their goal. This would include diet monitoring, diet suggestions, footstep monitoring, sleep suggestion, water alarm. This application is for all the people who want to maintain their health without going to the gym. This app would be giving free trail for 1-2 months to all their user. In addition to that, Every-time user would be notified on their progress and would be rewarded with some discount coupons or free health checkup for being consistent on their goal.</p>
								h3> Description </h3>
									  <p>The application would be available free for all the user who wants to keep monitor on their health whether he is young or old. Once the application gets installed on the device, he/she must have to register themselves with email and would have to enter their personal details, height, weight and their goal. After that, user must answer some basic questions about their health, if they might have any serious health issues. So accordingly, they would be provided their schedule. The user can see their profile anytime and can update his physical attributes which also effect on their routine.
                                                                           When the user opens the application, they would have to click on the start button to count their daily footsteps, calories in food, hours of sleep, how many glasses of water user drinks. And after observing few days of the user, system calculates the daily take of the user in 3 criteria’s: Proteins, Fats and Carbohydrates. The User must enter their daily intakes so that system can calculate how much he/she has consumed and how much he/she should take. The system has stored some food items calories, carbs, proteins in the database but the user can add new food items which will help the system to monitor the user diets. And the system would notify daily that how much the user had to walk in a day and how many calories they would have to take or burn depends on the user’s aim. For instance, if the user wants to gain some weight and he is willing to follow nutritional diet and he/she is not having some healthy grocery mentioned in the diet. So, the app can access device location and find him/her the nearby store where he/she can get the products.

                                                                           Every week the user can see his progress and status and for keeping them motivated they would get rewarded with some discount coupons or could get free health checkup at the prescribed stores. But this is only for the people who are serious about following all the prescribed activities time to time and are half way to their aim. Others gets some voucher for having started doing something for their health. The interesting fact about this application is that the user can sets alarm to get notified for something they want. Like the System tells the user how much water the user should intake and alarms him by notifying him about how much water he should have been consumed till now. They can set alarm for everything they want.
 
                                                                           System also suggest the user about hours of sleep he/she should take for the healthy life style. But if the user changes/updates something in their attributes, the output also changes accordingly. So, the user must enter correct details to get right output. And the user needs an active internet connection to use this application. User can have control over when they want to start their footstep counting, when to set alarm and when to get notified. </p>
								<h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
									  <p>As per my knowledge, android development tools like android studio, eclipse, game-maker studio etcetera is used and the device of windows 7/8/10 32-or-64bit with at least i3 processor or Mac OS X 10.10, minimum disk space of 3 GB, the memory of 3-GB ram and 1 GB for the android emulator and 1280 x 800 minimum screen resolution. These are the basic requirements for development of application. In addition to that, the visual studio or SQL server is needed and an android phone with KitKat version or higher than that.</p>
								<h3>Skills Required</h3>
									  <p>The depth knowledge of the java programming language and to aware about all the software and hardware required for development of application. Able to work on the development tool like android studio, SQL server. Analytical mind and the high-quality user interface are the main factor while developing an application. And to think what the user wants while working on the application is the core factor to keep in mind. Creative mind is also needed to come up with something different and useful for the user.</p>
								<h3>Outcome</h3>
									  <p>If the project gets succeed, then the people who want to track their health without going to the gym would be able to do it by just following some instructions from the application. The application would also help people to get their desired result.</p>
